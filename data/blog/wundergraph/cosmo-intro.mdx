## Overview: The Cosmo Stack

![Overview](/static/images/wundergraph/overview.png)

WunderGraph Cosmo isn't just another tool in the GraphQL ecosystem; it's a full-fledged GraphQL API Management Solution. Designed to manage Federated Graphs at scale, Cosmo offers a range of features from composition checks to analytics and distributed tracing. What sets it apart is its flexibility: you can run Cosmo locally, in the cloud, or even on-premises. And it's not just for federated graphs; Cosmo supports monolithic GraphQL APIs as well as Federation v1 and v2, including Subscriptions.

### The Cosmo Stack Components:

- **CLI (wgc)**: This is your command center for everything Cosmo. From pushing schemas to validating them and managing users, the CLI is incredibly versatile.
- **Control-Plane**: Think of this as the brain of Cosmo. It consists of the Platform API and the Node API, each serving a unique function in managing the platform. The Platform API is utilized by the Cosmo CLI tool and Studio for platform management. On the other hand, the Node API facilitates fleet-specific operations, carried out by the Router nodes.
- **Router**: This is the workhorse that takes care of routing requests to the appropriate subgraphs.
- **Studio**: This is where the magic happens. The Studio serves as your web interface for managing and collaborating on GraphQL Federation.

## The Architecture of Cosmo: Built on Key Principles

The architecture of Cosmo is nothing short of revolutionary, founded on several key principles that set it apart:

### Key Principles:

- **Open Source**: Cosmo is built on open standards like Open Telemetry (OTEL), S3, and Prometheus. This means you're not locked into a proprietary ecosystem. The Router is "source-available" under the BSL license, allowing for extensive customization.
- **High Availability**: One of the standout features of Cosmo is its focus on minimizing downtime. The Router is engineered to function independently. Its only dependency is on the CDN to load the configuration, which ensures an uptime of 99.999%.
- **Cost-Efficiency at Scale**: Cosmo is not just scalable; it's cost-efficient at scale. It's designed to handle even the most demanding use cases, capable of managing multiple billions of requests per month.
- **Hybrid Deployments**: Flexibility is key in today's fast-paced tech environment. Cosmo offers you the option to run the entire platform on your own infrastructure, ensuring 100% data sovereignty. Alternatively, you can use Cosmo's cloud services for the more complex "stateful" components.
- **Optimized Solution**: Cosmo's components are engineered to work in perfect harmony. This holistic approach not only optimizes operations but also significantly enhances the development experience.
