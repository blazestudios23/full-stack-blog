## Understanding Inigo's Security Features

### Query Protection and Control

Inigo takes query protection to the next level by blocking unauthorized queries, sizing them appropriately, and implementing rate limiting. These features ensure that only valid queries reach the server, providing a robust first line of defense.

#### Global Security Measures

Inigo's global security features allow for consistent enforcement across different teams and user profiles. This means you don't have to write the same rules in different schemas, saving time and reducing complexity.

### Access and Authorization Management

Access control is at the heart of Inigo's security model. With directives, role management, and schema-based access control, Inigo offers granular security that can be tailored to specific needs.

#### Special Security Considerations

From handling login APIs to protecting against brute force attacks, Inigo's advanced security techniques provide an extra layer of protection. Features like IP filtering and response filtering add to Inigo's comprehensive security toolkit.

## Error Handling in Inigo

### Basics of Error Handling

Errors are inevitable, but how you handle them makes all the difference. Inigo distinguishes between user errors and back-end errors, providing transparency and effective error tracing.

#### Advanced Error Handling Techniques

Inigo's approach to error handling goes beyond the basics. With severity levels, mitigation strategies, and alerting, you can prioritize important errors and take appropriate action.

### Ownership and Responsibility

Who owns an error? Inigo helps you find the owner of a particular error, associating it with a user or team. This ownership model enhances accountability and helps in identifying potential issues.

## Making Security and Error Handling Accessible

### Inigo's User-Friendly Approach

Inigo's user-friendly interfaces, CLI, and configuration options make complex security and error handling accessible. Whether you're a startup or a medium-sized company, Inigo's features can be tailored to fit your needs.

### Real-World Applications and Use Cases

Inigo's features are not just theoretical; they are applied in real-world scenarios. From handling nullable fields in SQL databases to tracing intermittent errors, Inigo's analytics and transparency tools provide valuable insights.

## Conclusion

Inigo's security and error handling features offer a comprehensive solution for teams managing GraphQL services. With a focus on user-friendly design and real-world applications, Inigo stands out as a valuable tool for enhancing security and managing errors effectively.
