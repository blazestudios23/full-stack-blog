# Introduction

Imagine a world where developing GraphQL APIs is a breeze, where complexity is tamed, and productivity soars. In this article, we'll embark on a journey to explore the revolutionary code-first approach, combined with the powerful tools Nexus GraphQL and Prisma ORM. Together, they form a trifecta that simplifies GraphQL API development, accelerates productivity, and transforms the developer experience.

Picture this: You're working on a complex API, and making a simple change to a database table requires updating multiple files. The codebase feels like a labyrinth, and your development velocity suffers. But fret not, as we dive into the world of code-first GraphQL, Nexus, and Prisma, your API development struggles will become a distant memory.

# Understanding Code-First GraphQL

In the realm of GraphQL development methodologies, code-first GraphQL stands tall, bringing a refreshing approach to the table. Instead of starting with the schema definition, code-first GraphQL urges developers to unleash their creativity and focus on writing application code. The rest? It's magically generated from your code, eliminating the tedious manual work of stitching schemas together.

## Streamlining Development with Nexus GraphQL

Enter Nexus GraphQL, an open-source library that becomes your trusty companion on this code-first journey. Nexus integrates seamlessly with renowned GraphQL frameworks like Apollo GraphQL, empowering you with a declarative API to define your GraphQL schema and types.

With Nexus, crafting your GraphQL types, queries, and mutations becomes a joyful experience. Bid farewell to boilerplate code, as Nexus handles the generation of the necessary schema and types. The result? A modular and organized codebase that facilitates seamless updates and shields you from the chaos of API maintenance.

## Enhancing Database Management with Prisma ORM

Managing database migrations becomes a breeze with Prisma's intuitive schema definition language. The simplicity and readability of this language make updating the database schema a straightforward process.

To update the database schema, simply add the desired changes to the Prisma schema file. Whether it's adding new tables, modifying existing fields, or defining relationships, the process is as simple as updating the schema definition. With just a few lines of code, you can express your desired changes.

Once the changes are made, generating a migration becomes effortless. Prisma's powerful CLI tools analyze the differences between the current schema and the updated schema, generating a migration script that captures the necessary database changes. This migration script ensures that the database schema seamlessly aligns with the new schema definition.

Prisma handles the intricate details of database migration management, making the process smooth and error-free. Whether you're working with a small-scale project or a large-scale enterprise application, Prisma's database migration capabilities streamline the process, saving you time and effort.

With Prisma's schema definition language and automated migration generation, you can focus on designing and evolving your database schema without the headaches typically associated with manual database management. Say goodbye to tedious SQL scripts and complex migration workflowsâ€”Prisma simplifies the entire process.

Embrace the power of Prisma ORM and its seamless integration with the code-first GraphQL approach. Experience the joy of effortlessly managing your database schema and migrations while building powerful and scalable GraphQL APIs.

Example Prisma Schema:

```JSON
generator prisma_client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
  ROOT
}

model User {
  id        String   @default(cuid()) @id
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  email     String   @unique
  username  String
  password  String
  role      Role     @default(USER)
  todos     Todo[]
}
```

## Autogenerated Types and Schema: Simplifying API Complexity

Let's talk about complexity. Picture the time-consuming process of modifying your API to accommodate a single database table change. It's daunting, error-prone, and stifles productivity. But with code-first GraphQL, Nexus, and Prisma, this complexity dissipates like a passing cloud.

Adopting the code-first approach, you can add or modify fields in your application code, and watch as the types, schema, and resolvers are automatically updated. Gone are the days of manual updates and the fear of introducing errors. With autogeneration in action, you'll witness the simplification of complex APIs, empowering you to focus on building extraordinary GraphQL experiences.

## Accelerating Development and Elevating Developer Experience

By embracing code-first GraphQL, Nexus, and Prisma, you unlock the true potential of API development. You'll witness a remarkable acceleration in your development process, delivering APIs with unrivaled speed and precision.

The journey doesn't end there. Code-first GraphQL, Nexus, and Prisma enhance the developer experience in profound ways. With hot-reloading, comprehensive error handling, and advanced debugging capabilities, you'll find yourself in a developer utopia. Collaboration among teams becomes seamless, allowing for increased productivity and sparking the flames of innovation.

## Real-World Use Cases and Success Stories

Here's an exmaple of what a code first GraphQL service looks like, when can be seen in this [repository](https://github.com/arbytez/boilerplate-nexus-prisma-apollo-graphql-express):

This is an exmaple of a Nexus type, which is resolved by Prisma and autogeneartes the GraphQL Schema.

```TypeScript
export const Todo = objectType({
  name: 'Todo',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id();
    t.model.createdAt();
    t.model.updatedAt();
    t.model.content();
    t.model.done();
    t.model.user();
  },
});
```

Example of GraphQL queries using Prisma and Nexus with pagination, ordering and filtering:

```TypeScript
export const todoNexusQuery = extendType({
  type: 'Query',
  definition(t) {
    t.crud.todo();
    t.crud.todos({ filtering: true, ordering: true, pagination: true });
  },
});
```

Example of Mutatins:

```TypeScript
export const todoNexusMutation = extendType({
  type: 'Mutation',
  definition(t) {
    t.crud.createOneTodo();
    t.crud.updateOneTodo();
    t.crud.upsertOneTodo();
    t.crud.deleteOneTodo();
    t.crud.updateManyTodo();
    t.crud.deleteManyTodo();
  },
});
```
